%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NOTES:
% - The implementations follow the notation of Ethan Eade's tech report,
%   which is a concise reference for various relevant Lie groups. Simple
%   arithmetic manipulation (using the properties of w_hat discussed in the
%   tutorial) shows the equivalence to the formulation on the lecture
%   slides. Of course you can also implement those variants.
% - Taylor expansions are used for small theta to avoid numerical issues of
%   dividing by something close to 0. This is not strictly needed, but at
%   least a check for theta != 0 should be added.
%
% Additional ressources on common Lie Groups used in 3D computer vision:
%  - Lie Groups for 2D and 3D Transformations (Ethan Eade)
%  - A tutorial on SE(3) transformation parameterizations and on-manifold optimization (Jose-Luis Blanco)

%% Bonus: Section about epsilon and Taylor expansion
% This explores the effect of using the Taylor expansion for small inputs
% by comparing to expm / logm. This is not a perfect test, since we are not
% certain about the accuracy of expm / logm. It can be seen that the Taylor
% expansion is only valid for small angles (as expected). For exp we can 
% also clearly see that for input norms around 1e-4 or smaller the Taylor 
% expansion seems to be more consistent with expm. For log, maybe the 
% Taylor expansion is less relevant, as both seem to be consistent with 
% logm for small values.
